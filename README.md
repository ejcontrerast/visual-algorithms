# Project on Course

This is a personal project developed during my spare time, where I document and showcase the visualisation and of various coding algorithms. The repository serves as a practical demonstration of algorithm implementations, providing insights into their development and functionality.

Additionally, this space will feature design concepts and ideas, offering a comprehensive view of both the technical and visual aspects of the project.

Feel free to explore the implementations and design proposals shared here.

## General Design Principles

* Font Design: will be use [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=Poppins) for Redability
* Colors: First will be dark mode then will be the implementation of the light mode.
* Responsive: Fully functional on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* Consistency for reusable style.

## Color Pallete for Dark Mode:
* Background: bg-gray-900
* Primary text: text-gray-100
* Accent: text-teal-400 or text-indigo-500
* Buttons: bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-500

## Algorithm Page
* Sidebar Navigation
  * Fixed, collapsible side bar with a list of algorithms.
* Main Content
  * Algorithm title and short description.
  * Big O notation
  * Pseudocode in python and JavaScript with real-world examples.
  * Interactive Canvas
    * Area with the visualization with animation controls. Just basic at first: Play and reset
  * Algorithms variants DFS and BFS for the future implementation

## Possile ideas
* Progressive Visualizations: As the algorithm runs, animate each step with visual feedback (e.g., highlighted nodes in graphs).
* Tooltips: On hover, provide brief explanations for UI elements.
* Breadcrumbs: Show navigation hierarchy for better orientation.
* Custom Controls: Allow users to adjust parameters dynamically (e.g., array size for sorting algorithms).
